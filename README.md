## The reason to choose this topic
I am interested in peopleâ€™s story in terms of disability. USA has issue of immigrant, Japan has the same issue as well. As an issue of employment, people always argue about immigrant, but people do not care about employed people who have disabilities.

I have a stuttering, and I struggled getting a job in Japan, stuttering was huge obstacle for me.


## Story of workers people who have disabilities in the US
### Personal story which is about Gallacher
This is happend in the US.

Gallacher, 28, is a computer expert. He has a bachelor's degree in management and entrepreneurship from Louisiana Tech University. Yet most employers don't give him a second glance when they learn he's blind, even though he is able to operate a computer just fine with a screen reader.

Gallacher is one of nearly 57 million disabled people in America.

Today marks the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), a civil rights act passed in 1990 to fight discrimination against the disabled.

Since its inception, much has changed for the better. Supermarket aisles are wider, schools have ramps, and public transportation is more accessible for the disabled.

But there's one thing that's deteriorated for them -- employment.

### Show me the jobs
Employment for disabled Americans has actually fallen since 1990, and there's an even bigger gap between disabled and non-disabled jobs prospects today.

In the early 1990s, about half of disabled Americans were employed, according to Census data. Today that has fallen to just 41%. Some of the decline is due to an aging population. Older workers are more likely to have disabilities, especially physical ones.

But it's telling that the employment rate of disabled Americans has dropped more than for the non-disabled.

The problems often start at an early age.

### Basic barriers remain
While in high school, Gallacher had three teachers who he says didn't accommodate for his disability in their classes. He found similar problems when he entered college, which is why he transferred to Louisiana Tech from a different university that did not cater to his needs at all.

"As a mother of student with disability, I've seen how many schools don't have ramps that are usable. I am just stunned that there hasn't been more attention in our education system to these very obvious emblems of discrimination," said Susan Dooha, executive director of the Center for Independence of the Disabled, who herself suffers from a traumatic brain injury.

Being fully blind in the small town of Pearl River in Louisiana does not open up a lot of options for Gallacher. He says he might be the only disabled person in his town so people don't know how to deal with him.

The only jobs he's had are volunteering stints. He still lives with his parents and is grateful they support him financially.

"I'm always amazed at how many job applications I try to fill it out online but can't get any further because the rest of the offline application becomes inaccessible," said Gallacher. Many businesses no longer list Human Resources contact info, so he can't even call to seek help.

### Low wage jobs
Even for those with jobs, the prospects remain bleak. Disabled persons earn significantly less than non-disabled, and the gap between annual earnings has widened since the early 1990s.

Disabled workers earn about $9,000 less a year than a non-disabled workers, according to Census data on median earnings. That gap was under $6,000 in the early 1990s.

A report by the Center for Independence of the Disabled found that the top job for non-disabled people is teaching. For the disabled, it's janitorial duties.

It often takes individual companies changing their policies to really make a difference. Some large companies like Citigroup (C) and Google (GOOG) are going the extra mile to include the disabled.

## The Process
My assumption is correct as you can see it above, but after reading reaticle below, I realized my assumption is incorrect. The situation is going to be bad.

As like me, a lot of people misunderstand the real situation of issue, so I created the data visualization to tell truth to citizens in the US.

I started thinking about to make a [histogram map](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/histogram.html) whcih expresses the time-based transition of social security expences for people who have disability.

I decided to combine it with Choropleth Map which expresses the geographical data of patient worker list.

Data visualization comparing the number of workers with disabilities and the number of workers not having disabilities. And people can see on map which state in the US is hiring the most disabled people and which state is not hiring the most.

I used datas below:

* [Data Retrieval: Labor Force Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab6.htm)
* [DSee How Your State Ranks In Employment Among Workers with Disabilities](http://fortune.com/2017/02/28/disability-employment-rank/)

I assumed that New York State and California states, emigrant-friendly states are also promoting employment of people who have disabilities. But the reality was different. Rather than, the state who has few population and few immigrants positively hires disabled people. The reason of that companies do not have many choices in rural state in the US? As expected, the number of employed people wit

Finally I created data visualization below:
1. Showing the difference of employed population rate of people who have disabilities and people who are not disabled state by state.
2. Showing the difference of number of employed poeple who have disabilities and people who are not disabled.


## Analysis
I assumed that New York State and California states, emigrant-friendly states are also promoting employment of people who have disabilities. But the reality was different. Rather than, the state who has few population and few immigrants positively hires disabled people. The reason of that companies do not have many choices in rural state in the US? As expected, the number of employed people with disabilities is very small compared to general people.
